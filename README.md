CLI for [JustLend](https://justlend.org) on TRON. Covers V2 (Moolah) lending, V1 legacy lending, sTRX / stUSDT staking, energy rental and direct purchase, governance, rewards, airdrops, mining reads, historical records, pre-sign transaction prechecks, and safe dry-run simulation.

> Current status: active CLI implementation with read paths, selected write paths, TronLink signer integration, JSON output, and dry-run simulation. Production/mainnet validation is not required for QA pass criteria; Nile/testnet dry-run is the default safety regression path.

## Requirements

- Recommended: Node.js **24.22.1** (used by development and CI)
- npm
- TronLink browser extension + `tronlink-signer` only when signing real write transactions
- TRON API key is optional; pass `--api-key <key>` or set `JUSTLEND_API_KEY` / `TRON_API_KEY`

## Installation

The CLI is not currently published to npm. Install it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justlend/justlend-cli.git
cd justlend-cli
nvm install && nvm use # when using nvm
npm ci
npm run build
npm link
```

After installation, the `justlend` command is available globally.

## Common validation commands

```bash
# Full local verification used before commits / releases
npm run check

# Individual stages
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build

# Nile dry-run smoke. This builds on dist/bin/cli.js, so run build first.
npm run test:smoke:nile
```

### Energy direct purchase

The purchase API is separately deployed. The CLI uses the same official production endpoint as the
app release by default: `https://tegrow.ablesdxd.link`. Limits, durations, prices, payment address,
and pool capacity remain live backend data; no economic values are hard-coded. A custom/test endpoint
requires an explicit URL and the standard untrusted-host opt-in.

```bash
export JUSTLEND_ENERGY_API_URL="https://energy-api.example" # optional override
export JUSTLEND_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_HOSTS=1 # temporary/custom endpoints only

# Read live backend limits, prices, and pool capacity
justlend energy purchase config

# Read-only authoritative quote
justlend energy purchase quote 65000 --receiver TReceiverAddress...

# Quote-only dry run: no wallet and no signed transaction
justlend --dry-run energy purchase buy 65000 --receiver TReceiverAddress...

# Explicit write: prompts before signing; --yes is required for non-TTY/JSON use
justlend --yes energy purchase buy 65000 --receiver TReceiverAddress...

# Reconcile a payment whose submission result was unknown
justlend energy purchase risk TPayerAddress...

# Read public purchase history; add --page/--size for server pagination
justlend energy purchase history TPayerAddress...
```

The CLI signs a native TRX transfer but **never broadcasts it locally**. The configured energy
service validates and broadcasts the signed transaction. Ambiguous submissions retry only the same
signed transaction. For ambiguous submissions, the exact signed request (including the signature and
raw transaction) is persisted in the local mode-`0600`
`~/.justlend-cli/energy-payment-risks.json` file. It remains broadcastable until transaction expiry,
is redacted from normal command output, and is removed only after public purchase history confirms the
payment/order or the backend deterministically rejects it before broadcast. This prevents a later
invocation from silently creating a second payment. A per-payer intent lock is also created atomically before signing, so concurrent CLI
processes cannot authorize two payments. The final authoritative quote must exactly match the amount
shown at confirmation time. Corrupt or unreadable safety state blocks purchases instead of being
treated as empty. Risk output distinguishes FullNode `observed`/`included` status from SolidityNode
`solidified` finality; an RPC error or missing transaction remains unresolved and cannot authorize a
new signature. `--no-broadcast` is intentionally rejected for this workflow; use `quote` or
`--dry-run` instead.

## Safe dry-run examples

Dry-run is the recommended way to test write paths. It does not sign and does not broadcast.

```bash
OWNER=TCrDi83pUoK17GbwxN1SckM3YNXzahWvoN

justlend --json --network nile --dry-run --dry-run-owner "$OWNER" strx stake 0.000001
justlend --json --network nile --dry-run --dry-run-owner "$OWNER" stusdt wrap 0.000001
justlend --json --network nile --dry-run --dry-run-owner "$OWNER" wtrx wrap 1
justlend --json --network nile --dry-run --dry-run-owner "$OWNER" wtrx unwrap 1
justlend --json --network nile --dry-run --dry-run-owner "$OWNER" v1 deposit TRX 0.000001
justlend --json --network nile --dry-run --dry-run-owner "$OWNER" gov exchange 0.000001
```

For real writes, prefer this escalation path:

```bash
# 1. Simulate without signer / broadcast
justlend --network nile --dry-run --dry-run-owner "$OWNER" strx stake 0.000001

# 2. Sign only, no broadcast
justlend --network nile --no-broadcast strx stake 0.000001

# 3. Broadcast intentionally; interactive TTY prompts unless --yes is supplied
justlend --network nile --yes strx stake 0.000001
```

A successful dry-run returns fields such as:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "mode": "dry-run",
    "status": "success",
    "selector": "d0e30db0",
    "energyUsed": 58112,
    "calldataLen": 8
  }
}
```

## Pre-sign preflight

Real write commands (those that sign + broadcast) run an automatic preflight
**before** the confirmation prompt and before any signing. The transaction is
built, then simulated via `triggerconstantcontract`, and the CLI:

- surfaces any decoded **revert reason** and aborts instead of signing a doomed tx;
- estimates the **energy + bandwidth burn** against live account resources and chain fee rates;
- **blocks** when the estimated fee exceeds `--fee-limit`, or when `callValue + fee` exceeds the signer's TRX balance;
- **warns** (without blocking) on affordable, non-zero burns so you know TRX will be spent.

This does not apply to `--dry-run` (which already simulates and never signs).
Pass `--no-precheck` to skip the preflight — e.g. when chain reads are flaky and
you have already validated the call with `--dry-run`.

```bash
# Default: preflight runs automatically before the confirm prompt
justlend --network nile --yes strx stake 0.000001

# Skip the preflight (you accept the risk of a failed / over-budget broadcast)
justlend --network nile --yes --no-precheck strx stake 0.000001
```

## Signer daemon

`justlend serve` runs the TronLink signer + IPC server so subsequent commands
reuse one wallet session. It writes per-session state under `~/.justlend-cli`
with `0600/0700` permissions (creation aborts if the socket cannot be locked
down). The daemon auto-shuts down after `--idle-timeout` minutes with no IPC
activity (default `10`; `0` disables); a request in flight always defers
shutdown so it never exits mid-signature.

```bash
justlend serve                      # idle auto-shutdown after 10 min
justlend serve --idle-timeout 30    # extend the idle window
justlend serve --idle-timeout 0     # run until stopped (Ctrl+C / SIGTERM)
```

## JSON output contract

Success:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",
  "success": true,
  "data": {}
}
```

Failure (written as exactly one JSON object to stderr, including parser/usage failures):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",
  "success": false,
  "error": "unknown command 'example'",
  "code": "CLI_USAGE_ERROR",
  "retryable": false,
  "hint": "Run `justlend --help` or `justlend <command> --help` and correct the arguments."
}
```

The machine-readable JSON Schema is [`schemas/output-v1.schema.json`](./schemas/output-v1.schema.json). Consumers should pin the `schemaVersion` **major**: additive fields may appear within v1, while a removal, rename, or semantic break requires v2. Failures may include diagnostic fields such as `module`, `network`, `host`, `path`, `status`, and `hint`.

### Error / exit code contract

Branch on the **exit code** first (`0` = success, non-zero = failure), then on the JSON `code` field.

| `code` | Meaning | Retryable | How to handle |
|--------|---------|:---:|---------------|
| `CLI_USAGE_ERROR` | Unknown command, option, or invalid argument | ❌ | Correct arguments using `--help`; never retry unchanged |
| `USER_CANCELLED` | Rejected/cancelled in TronLink | ❌ | Re-approve in wallet |
| `SIGNER_TIMEOUT` | TronLink approval timed out | ⚠️ (user must be present) | Retry, approve promptly |
| `SIGNER_DISCONNECTED` | Signer page closed / IPC dropped | ⚠️ after reconnect | Keep the TronLink signer page open, retry |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Not enough balance | ❌ | Top up |
| `INSUFFICIENT_ALLOWANCE` | TRC20 allowance too low | ❌ | `justlend approve <token>` first |
| `INVALID_ADDRESS` | Malformed TRON address | ❌ | Fix the Base58 address |
| `NETWORK_CONNECTION_FAILED` | Connection failure | ✅ | Exponential backoff |
| `BROADCAST_FAILED` | Tx broadcast rejected | ❌ (write) | Inspect, retry manually — never auto-retry |
| _(HTTP backend error)_ | Carries `status`/`host`/`path`/`hint` | `5xx`/network ✅, `4xx` ❌ | Follow `hint` |

**Retry policy:** only read-only backend calls marked idempotent are auto-retried (2 attempts with
backoff). Signing and broadcast paths are **never** auto-retried (double-submit risk).

## V2 mining claims

V2 mining backend APIs are mainnet-only. Nile mining commands intentionally return a guard error rather than pretending to succeed. The mainnet V2 distributor is configured, but deployment alone does not mean a reward round is claimable. `mining claim-info <periodKey>` only reports backend payload status: it does not validate the proof, published root, or on-chain claim status, and never signs or submits a transaction. Preview a round with `airdrop claim --period <periodKey> --address <owner> --dry-run` before deciding to submit it.

## Mining compatibility and deployment policy

`mining claim` remains a deprecated **read-only** alias; its JSON includes
`canonicalCommand`, `deprecatedAlias`, and `transactionSubmitted: false`.
SUN registry entries are historical, not proof of active campaigns. Query V1
`rewards summary` and V2 `mining accruing` / `mining apy` separately; an API failure
or malformed reward response is unavailable/unknown, not zero rewards or an ended campaign.

Configuration snapshots in `tests/fixtures/deployments.verified.json` separate
mainnet from the internally linked Nile deployment. ETHB uses on-chain 18 decimals;
Nile USDT/USDCOLD match their jToken underlying() calls. Do not replace these values
with another App deployment profile. Unknown networks fail before host overrides.
CLI default fee limit is 100 TRX, SDK 200 TRX, and MCP's generic fallback 1000 TRX
(with operation overrides). These are ceilings, not estimated or actual fees;
inspect dry-run/resource estimates and the explicit transaction budget.

## Risk alerts (read-only)

Configure an explicitly trusted HTTPS `JUSTLEND_ALERT_API_URL` (no implicit host),
or pass `justlend alerts --api-url <url>` before the subcommand:

```bash
justlend alerts list <address> --json
justlend alerts rules --json
justlend alerts markets <address> --json
```

Only mainnet TRON public list/rule/market reads are supported. These commands do
not access the signer, reveal email addresses, or carry device/cookie/session IDs.
Errors remain errors/unknown; null thresholds remain unavailable, not zero.
Create/edit/enable/disable/delete and email operations are intentionally absent
pending a confirmed headless session contract. The signing prefix
`JustLend DAO Risk Alert` is a protocol invariant, not product display branding.
